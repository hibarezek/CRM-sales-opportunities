This project is a data visualization project that includes data preprocessing, data manipulation, and then data visualization into useful insights using power bi. 

The dataset used in this project is taken from Maven Analytics's website and it was a challenge for April 2024. The original dataset before any transformation is at: https://mavenanalytics.io/challenges/maven-sales-challenge/

The KPIs that the project focuses on are the overall sales performance for the products by time, sector, and location(in the first page) and the team performance by quarter based on each manager and their sales agents, win to lose ratios in deals, the average deal size of each team, the top performing sales agents and products(second page).

There are more insights that could be derived from this dataset, but this project's main focus was on the products, sectors, managers and sales agents primarly.
